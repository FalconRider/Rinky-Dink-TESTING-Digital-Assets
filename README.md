# Rinky-Dink-TESTING-Digital-Assets

A series of digital assets for free use if testing Solidity collectable collections on Ropsten or Rinkelby networks.

 Wanted to test if I could construct such an item firstly.
 Now I'll see how to use them to test, my tests. 
 
 Created in MS Paint on a Windows 8 laptop. 
 Each one an origial digital creation by moi. Free use by all.
 Can be resized or altered freely.  2 resize examples  200 px across. 40 percent.
 Each one not great - but you have a series to putz with. And a couple special ones.
